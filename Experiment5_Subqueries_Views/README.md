# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose Address as Delhi

```sql
select * from customers where address in ('Delhi');
```

**Output:**

**Question 2**
---
Write a SQL query that retrieves the all the columns from the Table Grades, where the grade is equal to the minimum grade achieved in each subject.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM GRADES
WHERE (subject, grade) IN (
    SELECT subject, MIN(grade)
    FROM GRADES
    GROUP BY subject
);
```

**Output:**

**Question 3**
---
From the following tables, write a SQL query to find those salespeople who earned the maximum commission. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, and salesman_id.

```sql
SELECT ord_no, 
       purch_amt, 
       ord_date, 
       salesman_id
FROM orders
WHERE salesman_id IN (
    SELECT salesman_id
    FROM salesman
    WHERE commission = (SELECT MAX(commission) FROM salesman)
);
```

**Output:**

from orders
where salesman_id in (select salesman_id from salesman where city = 'New York')
```

**Output:**
